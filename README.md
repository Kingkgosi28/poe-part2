Overview - 
The Claims System enables lecturers to submit requests for payment based on hours worked, along with the ability to upload supporting documents. Coordinators and managers can then review, approve, or reject these submissions. The system keeps an updated record of the current status of each claim.

Features - 
Lecturer Claim Submission: Lecturers can file claims by entering their hours worked and hourly rates.
File Upload: Optionally, lecturers can upload supporting documents (formats supported include PDF, DOCX, and XLSX, with a maximum file size of 5MB).
Claim Review and Decision: Coordinators and managers can review all pending claims and approve or reject them. They can also view any uploaded documents, both in the application and in the stored files.
Status Monitoring: The system tracks the status of claims (e.g., Pending, Approved, Rejected), and updates these statuses in real time based on the actions of managers or coordinators.
Role-Based Permissions: The system provides different roles for lecturers, coordinators, and managers (with coordinators and managers having the same level of functionality).

How to Use - 
Submitting a Claim (Lecturer): Log in with the lecturer credentials. Navigate to the "Submit Claim" section. Complete the form by entering the required hours worked and hourly rate, along with any optional notes. If necessary, upload a supporting document (PDF, DOCX, XLSX), then click "Submit Claim." You will be directed to the Claim Status page, where you can track the status of your claim and view other submitted claims (Pending, Approved, or Rejected).
